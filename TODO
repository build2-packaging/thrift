- Add remaining (conditional) tests depending on presence of libevent,
  openssl etc. See the below HOWTO for details and libevent for examples:

  https://github.com/build2/HOWTO/blob/master/entries/convey-additional-information-with-exe-lib.md
  - Done.

- Change config.libthrfit.{libz, openssl, libevent} to false once we
  have support for custom CI configuration.

- Re-enable for-loop in libthrift-tests recipe once build2 issues are fixed.
